# Reaktor Birdnest pre-assignment 2023

Reaktor Developer Trainee for summer 2023 pre-assignment. Includes frontend and backend. Frontend is made with ReactJS and backend is made with Node.js and Express.js.

[See the frontend running on GitHub pages.](https://niemiville.github.io/reaktor-birdnest/)

[Server's API link to get the NDZ violator data.](https://birdnest-api-vn.onrender.com/api/violations/)

**NOTE: I am using free plan on Render (Node.js server hosting site), so the server will sleep after 15 minutes of no usage. Give it a little bit time to start collecting data. Wait a minute after opening the frontend or server API link and there should be already some data on the server.**
