# Reaktor Birdnest pre-assignment 2023 backend (server)

Server is build with Node.js and deployed to [Render Could Application Hosting Service](https://render.com/)

[Server API link to get the NDZ violator data](https://birdnest-api-vn.onrender.com/api/violations/)

[See the frontend running on GitHub pages.](https://niemiville.github.io/reaktor-birdnest/)

**NOTE: I am using free plan on Render, so the server will sleep after 15 minutes of no usage. Give it a little bit time to start collecting data. Wait a minute after opening the frontend or server API link and there should be already some data on the server.**
